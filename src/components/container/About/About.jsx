        Dead or Wounded (DOW) is a play-to-earn decentralised game where players
        can earn DOW tokens (Dead or Wounded DApp native token). Early adopters
        are rewarded with 100 free DOW tokens to interact with the DApp as
        players are required to spend DOW tokens to access the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Players stand a chance to win more DOW tokens for each round they win.
        The amount of token a player wins will be determined by their
        performance in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dead or Wounded is beginner friendly and does not require players to
        have any technical knowledge as it seeks to improve adoption of Web3 and
        give users the opportunity to earn while having fun.
