## About

Dead or Wounded (DOW) is a play-to-earn decentralised game where players
can earn DOW tokens (Dead or Wounded DApp native token). Early adopters are rewarded with some free DOW tokens on their first interaction with
the DApp to gain access to play, as players are required to spend DOW
tokens to access the game.
Players stand a chance to win more DOW tokens for each round they win. The amount of token a player wins will be determined by their performance in the game.
Dead or Wounded is beginner friendly and does not require players to have any technical knowledge as it seeks to improve adoption of Web3 and give users the opportunity to earn while having fun.
